# MinecraftGL
This program was developed by Victor Alvizo using OpenGL and C++
DISCLAIMER: The game is not the smoothest as this was remake was
created to further my OpenGL skills, so block placement and collisons
are not spot on. This program also employs multithreading.
Play window is resizeable and information of your moniter 
will be displayed as well.
